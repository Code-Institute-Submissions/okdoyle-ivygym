<h2>Website Description</h2>
<p>I spent one happy year living and working in Dublin 8 in 2015. I was a member of Ivy Gym. 
Off all the gyms I have ever been a memvber off this is my faveourite. It's unique selling point 
is it's swimming pool area, with a suana, steam room, cool pool, and jacuzzi. This for makes this gym special.

It was with this in mind that I opted to use an aqua colour scheme for the website, and promote images of the pool, where possible.
I opted for minimal elegant typefaces to create a clean modern look and feel. The finished deign retains a restrained colour palete which complements the aqua theme.


<h2>Usablity</h2>

The website is based around a standard 3 column container bootsrap grid. It makes use of large hero images where possible to differinciate the pages. 
The logo and navbar are descreet and ever present, centered at the top of the page. The navigation is clear and the user can easily travel through out the website
and reach their goals. Colour is introduced to display the gyms varous offerings from classes to the SWIM TRAIN SPIN core message. The pages are consistant in their design but 
use colour and different images so as to ensure a flow and journey to every page.  

<h2>User Experience</h2>
The goal of any user experience is to convey the persoanlity of the gym, while retaining a high level of usablity. 
The personality of Ivy gym is not exlusive or high end, it is a very reasonably priced, accessable gym with 
excellent water facilites and this features strongly in the design. The home page opens with the heroshot
of the pool, this is for most potential members and huge selling point. The user can imagine swimming in that water
after a run or weight training. This creates an instant good feeling for the user. The colour scheme retains the personality of the pool
area while introducing , with easy layout and colour, the various other features the gym has to offer.
